# AutoVibe Gym - Live Status

**Last updated:** 2026-05-29 (docs sync: TZ.md, PROTOCOL.md fallback contract, EXPERIMENT_REPORT)
**Phase:** COMPLETE. All infrastructure merged (PR #13). 158 tests passing. Awaiting notebook-era experiment runs on H200.

---

## Current Sprint Goal

Harden the merged real Jupyter + Docker-backed kernel environment with
behavioral privacy tests, deterministic PR CI, and minimal fixes for discovered
test, sandbox, and logging gaps.

## Status by Component

### Core Gym (`gym/`)

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `notebook.py` | Done | nbformat v4 document editing, stable cell ids, revisions, outputs, Python export |
| `jupyter_kernel.py` | Done | persistent local `ipykernel`; Docker kernel backend with loopback-only ZMQ ports and workspace path translation |
| `notebook_env.py` | Done | real notebook action loop, clean restart-and-run-all, validate, submit, public/private artifacts |
| `feedback.py` | Done | runtime/contract/checklist/terminal feedback items and generic hidden checklist policy |
| `candidates.py` | Done | candidate records and validation registry |
| `modes.py` | Done | `gym_with_checklist` and `iterative_no_checklist` share the same backend |
| `protocol.py` | Done | notebook actions added; legacy `code` action remains compatible |
| `agent.py` | Done | prompt updated for notebook actions and clean-run/validate/submit contract |
| `llm.py` | Done | OpenAI-compatible, Google/Gemini, and LiteLLM client selection |
| `env.py` | Legacy maintained | old subprocess/Docker environment retained for compatibility tests |
| `executor.py` | Legacy/baseline | Docker/subprocess executor retained for non-notebook baselines |

### Experiments (`experiments/`)

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `run_gym.py` | Done | uses `NotebookGymEnv`, logs notebook/process/private metrics, artifacts to MLflow |
| `run_baseline.py` | Done | single-shot control preserved; missing score is not logged as zero |
| `run_multishot.py` | Done | logged as `repeated_single_shot`; not the fair checklist control |
| `run_fixed.py` | Done | fixed-transition control preserved; failed submit is not logged as real score 0.0 |
| `compare.py` | Done | handles missing metrics without zero substitution |

### Privacy and Security

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Hidden test files | Done | not copied into episode workspace; no `test_df` in kernel |
| Hidden score feedback | Done | submit response hides score; score only in private summary/MLflow |
| Local Jupyter sandbox | Limited | real notebook functionality and sanitized env, but not full OS isolation |
| Docker kernel backend | Done | CI builds `Dockerfile.sandbox` and runs Docker integration smoke when Docker is available |
| Agent-visible artifacts | Done | public workspace artifacts exclude hidden score, private checklist coverage, submit failure type, and candidate pickle paths |
| Private evaluator artifacts | Done | private summaries, trajectories, and candidate pickles are stored outside the kernel-visible workspace |

### Tests

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Existing legacy env/executor/agent tests | Passing |
| Jupyter kernel tests | Passing |
| Notebook editing tests | Passing |
| Clean run / validate / submit tests | Passing |
| Checklist privacy/fairness tests | Passing |
| Hidden-test privacy tests | Passing |
| Docker kernel integration | Runs in GitHub Actions after sandbox image build |
| Step-budget semantics | Passing |

## Current Verification

Last local run:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=gym --cov=experiments --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70
```

Result after hardening changes: `154 passed, 2 skipped`, coverage `75.26%`.
The two skipped tests are Docker integration tests skipped only in the local
Windows environment because Docker CLI is unavailable; GitHub Actions now builds
`autovibe-gym-sandbox:latest` before pytest so these run in CI.

---

## Blocked / Needs Decision

- Local Docker CLI is unavailable in this Windows workspace, so Docker kernel
  integration is verified in GitHub Actions rather than locally.
- Existing `GymEnv` remains for compatibility, but new iterative experiments
  should use `NotebookGymEnv`.
- Repository owner still needs to confirm the `main` ruleset requires the
  `Python tests` status check before merge if connector/API access cannot verify
  rulesets.

## Next Actions

1. [x] Все PR смержены в main
2. [x] TZ.md, PROTOCOL.md, EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md синхронизированы
3. [ ] Запустить `python -m experiments.run_matrix --mode local` на H200 → получить notebook-era experiment results
4. [ ] Обновить EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md с новыми результатами после п.3
